# Picars
Kodi Skin for Star Trek Original Series (Raspberry Pi)
Modified from Confluence.
Driven by bash shell and python, the talking LCARS simulation works on the Raspberry PI. It does not have full functionality on the Amazon Fire Stick.
To install:
Unzip / Untar to the kodi addons directory. Might be something like /home/osmc/.kodi/addons or something ../addons.
Reboot and then the skin selection will apppear in the System menu, where you can choose skin.

I suggest setting the font to Picars.
